Chronos Tracker is a simple windows desktop app developed by prooheckcp.
It is used to keep track on long have you spent over the time with a certain task.

It was initially developed for personel use in order to keep track of long do I spend while studying and or doing other tasks. Eventually I though it would be better just make it a publicc app in order to allow anyone to use it as it can be extremly usefull. It uses both P5 and electron. All the information is stored locally meaning it wont transpass from computer to computer.I might eventually make a better version with access to the internet and cloud stored data.
